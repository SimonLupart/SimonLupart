# üëã Welcome to Simon Lupart's GitHub!

**PhD Candidate** in Information Retrieval (IR) at the **University of Amsterdam (UvA)**, part of the **IRLab**.  
With a strong background in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Information Retrieval**, I‚Äôm currently focused on cutting-edge research in areas such as:

- Conversational Search
- Distribution Shifts
- Adversarial Training
- Large Language Models (LLMs)

## üî¨ Research & Background
I hold a Master‚Äôs degree from ENSIMAG (Grenoble, France), and have previously worked at **Naver Labs Europe** within the Search and Recommendation team. Currently, I am pursuing my PhD under the supervision of:
- Prof. Dr. [Evangelos Kanoulas](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/e.kanoulas/)
- Dr. [Mohammad Aliannejadi](https://aliannejadi.com/)

My research interests revolve around improving IR systems to handle challenges in neural retrieval and adversarial conditions.
